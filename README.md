# Simple Scoreboard 

This project provides a simple but efficient implementation of a scoreboard system. It allows users to manage matches, update scores, and retrieve a summary of all games which are in-progress.

## Features:

- Easy management of matches: start, update scores, and finish.
- An ordered scoreboard based on the total score of the matches (default order, which can be changed easily)
- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) for efficiently conveying match summaries.
- Exception handling for common error scenarios.

## Requirements:

- Java 17

To run the project, ensure you have Java 17 installed and use the appropriate build and run commands for your development environment.
